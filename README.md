# Custom Web Component Framework

This project demonstrates a lightweight framework built using the Web Components API, mimicking some of the core functionalities of React.js. As a Technical Product Manager with a strong background in computer science and web technologies, I created this framework to showcase my understanding of modern web development concepts and ability to implement complex systems from scratch.

## Project Overview

This custom framework leverages the Web Components API to create a React-like development experience. It includes:

- A custom element definition system
- A simple state management solution
- JSX-like templating using template literals
- Basic routing capabilities
- Asynchronous data fetching

## Key Features

- **Custom Element Definition**: Easily define new components using a declarative syntax similar to React components.
- **State Management**: Simple state management system with reactive updates.
- **JSX-like Templating**: Use template literals for creating component templates, similar to JSX in React.
- **Event Handling**: Declarative event handling for components.
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: Built-in support for fetching and managing asynchronous data.

## Components

1. **simple-counter**: A basic counter component demonstrating state updates and event handling.
2. **user-details**: A component that fetches and displays user data, showcasing asynchronous operations.

## Technologies Used

- Vanilla JavaScript
- Web Components API
- Fetch API for data retrieval

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Explore the different components and their implementations

## Code Structure

- `your-framework.js`: Core framework implementation
- `simple-counter.js`: Example counter component
- `user-details.js`: Example user details component with async data fetching
- `index.html`: Main HTML file demonstrating component usage
- `user.json`: Sample user data (note: actual data is fetched from an API in the demo)

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a more robust state management system
- Add support for component lifecycle methods
- Develop a build process for optimizing the framework
- Create more complex example components to showcase framework capabilities
